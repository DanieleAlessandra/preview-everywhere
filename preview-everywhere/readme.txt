== Description ==
With this plugin every contributor will be able to check how his contents look like in every context.
it works with posts, pages and custom post types as well, and every contributor may enable his own previews (i.e. two or more users may create and navigate their own contents without interfering one another).

2. Activate the plugin from the “Plugins” page in WordPress.
3. While editing a content click on the green “Preview” button to save content as “visible to your account”.
  * A new browser window will show the single page preview.
